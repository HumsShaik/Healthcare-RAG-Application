# 🏥 Healthcare RAG Application

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, Ollama, and Streamlit. The application enables intelligent question answering over healthcare documents including clinical guidelines, compliance policies, and FDA recall notices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare organizations manage large volumes of clinical, regulatory, and compliance documentation. Finding relevant information quickly can be challenging and time-consuming.

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable users to ask natural language questions and receive grounded answers generated from healthcare documents.

The application retrieves relevant document sections using vector similarity search and generates responses using a local Large Language Model (LLM) running through Ollama.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Healthcare professionals frequently need to search across:

* Clinical Guidelines
* HIPAA Compliance Documents
* FDA Recall Notices
* Regulatory Documentation
* Patient Safety Policies

Manual review is inefficient and may delay access to critical information.

---

## 💡 Solution

This application:

1. Loads healthcare PDF documents
2. Splits documents into manageable chunks
3. Generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers
4. Stores embeddings in ChromaDB
5. Retrieves relevant content based on user questions
6. Uses Llama 3.2 via Ollama to generate answers grounded in retrieved content
